Required libraries for TSP
==========================

The following packages are required for use with C/Tcl.

JTcl does not require any external packages, as the required
packages 'hyde' and 'parser' are included in the JTcl distribution.

critcl-3.1.15 is no longer needed for tsp4tcc uses tcc4tcl

crtitcl can be found here, just in case    https://github.com/andreas-kupries/critcl/releases


tclparser-1.4.1
    Tclparser provides the 'parser' package.  This package is extracted from
    the TclPro open source project.

Precompiled binaries for win32 and linux64 are store in the subdir parser together with a pkgIndex.tcl
