add sugar and sugar {*} to jtcllib

change tsp_md5 proc to use original nested commands (partially complete)
hyde package - need to include "hyde" directory in env(TCL_CLASSPATH)  (like before????)

check over compiled commands: append, lappend  to be more like lappend - if
   var has been declared volatile for that command, just generated call to
   tcl command code.

c/tcl parser - must check [parse getstring $body {i-4 3}] and [parse getstring $body {i-3 3}]
for "{*}".  This is because c/tcl will expand simple text inside the parser, rather than
returning the "expand" node type.  bah.
HOWTO - check in 'whitespace' ie. the area between words for {*}
