check on commands in interpolated string
change tsp_md5 proc to use original nested commands
hyde package - need to include "hyde" directory in env(TCL_CLASSPATH)  (like before????)







0. clean up exit spill in generated code, only include try/catch if needed (to avoid unnecessary "if (callFrame == null)" )
0. implement nested commands [ ] in interpolated string


1. what to do with unset?  - probably generate a compile error.
   prob not needed.  just have commands that use 'varname' check if varname was in volatile list, if
   not, then spill var, and then add to volatile list in order to have it reloaded.


2. allocate tcl direct arrays for each number of arguments, or allocate largest used and Arrays.copyRangeOf() 
   to get the size needed for smaller sizes.



30. implement: expr list, lxxxxx, string, concat, append, join

40. implement simple case of: scan, format

99. implement C lang generation
