FIX - inline util code, note tsp-java inline code is out of date!

FIX - add info is tcl interp or tcl direct call doesn't return a value 
	(e.g. puts), don't add GetResultObj code

FIX - compile 'dict' command.  jtcl will need to have DictCmd.java private
      methods made public.
FIX - compile more 'string' subcommands.

FIX - convert tsp-clang strings int TSP_UniDString 

FIX:  lang_switch should pass a string tempvar, locked, to
      both clang and java.  clang needs it when switchvar is var type

EXPLORE - when loading var from interp, don't incr/decr ref count for this var??  
     test with cat-ext
EXPLORE - option for string type variables to just be 'var' instead.







CHECK: when assiging or converting from string, how do we
  handle usages of "string" {string} \str\ing \x73tring
  ??

CHECK: tsp-generate-set.tcl and tsp-clang, tsp-java
  use of ::tsp::lang_get_string_$
  should string just be passed to the ::tsp::lang_get_string_$ proc 
  to avoid ::tsp::lang_convert_string_string 


  


steal tcl.h determination of TCL_LL_MODIFIER and adapt to use as
TSP_LL_SUFFIX, since vc++, osx may need other than LL (e.g., vc++ I64 )


add sugar and sugar {*} to jtcllib

change tsp_md5 proc to use original nested commands (partially complete)
hyde package - need to include "hyde" directory in env(TCL_CLASSPATH)  (like before????)

c/tcl parser - must check [parse getstring $body {i-4 3}] and [parse getstring $body {i-3 3}]
for "{*}".  This is because c/tcl will expand simple text inside the parser, rather than
returning the "expand" node type.  bah.
HOWTO - check in 'whitespace' ie. the area between words for {*}
