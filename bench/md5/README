This is the md5 procedure from tcllib, version 1.4.4.

It has been un-obfuscated (i.e., the preprocessing steps
have already been performed), expr simplified to move nested
commands outside the expr expression, and tsp annotations 
and proc command applied. 


The benchmark compute the md5 hash for three different sized
strings, 32 bytes, ~4k bytes, and ~64k bytes.  The Tcl "time"
command is iterated as follows:
   32 bytes:  10 iterations
   4k bytes:   5 iterations
   64k bytes:  1 iteration

Before the benchmark is run, the interpreter and compiled
versions are allows to "warmup".  For C/Tcl the proc is
run once to byte code compiled it; for JTcl, the proc
is run 10,000 times to cause the C1/C2 compiler to optimize
the code.

Running the benchmark:

C Tcl 8.6.x 
   tclsh8.6 RUN.tcl

JTcl 2.8.0
   jtcl RUN.tcl
